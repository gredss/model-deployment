## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to help hotel management predict booking cancellations by developing a machine learning model based on historical booking data. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the model determines whether a booking will be confirmed or canceled. The dataset includes various features such as lead time, market segment, customer type, and seasonal factors.

To improve usability and practical application, the model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling users to upload new data and receive real-time predictions through an intuitive interface. This approach enhances accessibility for non-technical users and supports informed decision-making in hotel operations.
