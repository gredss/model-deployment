[`Click here to see the details`](streamlit/hotel-booking-status-binary-classification)

The Hotel Booking Status Classifier is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a hotel reservation will be honored or canceled. Utilizing structured booking data and the XGBoost algorithm, this model provides reliable predictions to assist hotel management in optimizing operational planning and reducing revenue loss due to cancellations.

### 📌 Key Objectives
- Develop a predictive model capable of classifying booking status using features such as lead time, market segment, customer type, and seasonal factors.
- Provide user-friendly access via a Streamlit web application, enabling real-time predictions based on user-uploaded data.

### 🔍 Core Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing, including imputation, encoding, and feature scaling
- Feature engineering and selection to enhance model performance and generalizability
- Deployment of an optimized XGBoost classifier, evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Structured, object-oriented codebase for scalability and deployment
- Interactive visualization of model results through an intuitive web interface
